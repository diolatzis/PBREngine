# PBREng - A Point-Based Rendering Game Engine
## MSc Project - Stavros Diolatzis - University of Leeds

This is a point-based rendering game engine developed in c++ as my MSc project @ University of Leeds. It aims to demonstrate the advantages of point-based rendering in the case of high resolution models and its uses in games. A simple game will also be developed using this engine to show the advantages of this rendering method.
